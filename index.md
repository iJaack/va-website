# The Verifier Alliance

Smart contracts are open source, but they're not easily accessible.

The Verifier Alliance is a consortium among key industry leaders that join together to build a Shared Database of source code files for the smart contracts of possibly all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains and beyond.

The Shared Database is publicly and easily accessible and can be freely used by developers, analysts and researchers to move the industry forward.

The Shared Database is just the first step of a long quest meant to unify smart contract's related data so they can be coherent across many different platforms and services.

To access the Shared Database, please [follow the quick guide]({base}/how).
