## Database

The main outcome of the Alliance is a shared database of contracts' source code on different EVM chains from different verification providers. The database is publicly accessible by anyone. 

One key aspect of the database is to have a common schema for verified contracts. The schema can be accessed [**here**]({base}/how).

## Shared knowledge

Current EVM source-code verification ecosystem is dispersed not only in data but also in knowledge. The Alliance is a place for collaboration and documentation of the verification know-how.

This includes publication of verification methods, intricacies of verification in each high-level language, and gathering the discovered edge cases.

## Open Source

The Alliance is dedicated to push the data and smart contract verification tooling become free and open source, and develop the tooling to make developers' lives easier.
